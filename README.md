# Stock Price App

#### This is a Python app that uses the streamlit library to display stock data from Yahoo Finance.
The app allows the user to select a date range and a ticker symbol (TSLA, AAPL, or GOOGL) and displays
the closing price and volume of the selected stock as a line chart.

 Additionally, the app displays a candlestick chart of the stock's open, high, low, and close prices, 
 along with two Simple Moving Averages (SMA) and two Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). 
 
 The user can also select a second ticker symbol to perform a correlation analysis with the first ticker symbol,
 displaying a correlation matrix of the daily returns of the two stocks.
